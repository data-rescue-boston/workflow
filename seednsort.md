## Seeding and Sorting Overview

Seeders and Sorters canvass the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They identify whether those URLs can be crawled by the Internet Archive's webcrawler. If the URLs are crawlable, the Seeders/Sorters nominate them to the End-of-Term (EOT) project, otherwise they add them to the Uncrawlable spreadsheet using the project's Chrome Extension.

## Choosing the website
The Seeders/Sorters team will use the EDGI subprimer systems ([found here](https://envirodatagov.org/agency-forecasts/)), or a similar set of resources, to identify important/at risk data. Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

## Canvassing the website and evaluating content
- Start exploring the website assigned, identifying important URLs. 
- Decide whether the data on a page or website subsection can be [automatically captured by the Internet Archive webcrawler](./what-heritrix-does.md).
- The best source of information about the seeding and sorting process is represented at [https://envirodatagov.org/](https://envirodatagov.org/).

## Using the NominationTool Chrome Extension

The [EDGI Nomination Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nominationtool/abjpihafglmijnkkoppbookfkkanklok?hl=en) is a simple tool for identifying important URL's and moving them into the Data Rescue system. Resources that can be captured by the Internet Archive will be "nominated" to the IA crawl. Resources appropriate to Data Rescue will go through a brief vetting process and eventually be harvested, checked, and "bagged." There is some overlap tbetween these two categories, so some resource will be **both** nominated and crawled. 

**Let's put some more info about how to use the tool here! Possibly send to the usage section of the tool repo so we don't have to keep rewriting, and so that tool devs can keep the dox in sync.**
